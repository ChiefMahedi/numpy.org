*数组计算是统计学、数学和当代数据科学及应用(如数据可视化、数字信号处理、图像处理、生物信息学、机器学习、AI等) 中的科学计算领域的基础。*

大规模数据操作和转换依赖于高效率高性能的数组计算。 数据分析、机器学习和数值计算的主流语言是 **Python**。

**Num**erical **Py**thon or NumPy is its de-facto standard Python programming language library that supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and comes with a vast collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

Since the launch of NumPy in 2006, Pandas appeared on the landscape in 2008, and it was not until a couple of years ago that several array computing libraries showed up in succession, crowding the array computing landscape. Many of these newer libraries mimic NumPy-like features and capabilities, and pack newer algorithms and features geared towards machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.

**Array computing** is based on **arrays** data structures. *Arrays* are used to organize vast amounts of data such that a related set of values can be easily sorted, searched, mathematically manipulated, and transformed easily and quickly.

Array computing is *unique* as it involves operating on the data array *at once*. What this means is that any array operation applies to an entire set of values in one shot. This vectorized approach provides speed and simplicity by enabling programmers to code and operate on aggregates of data, without having to use loops of individual scalar operations.
